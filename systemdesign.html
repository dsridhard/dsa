        <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Commands are tasks that change the state of the system.</li>

        <h2>Circuit Breaker</h2>
        <p><strong>Concept:</strong> A pattern to prevent a network or service failure from cascading to other services.</p>
        <p><strong>Details:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Acts as a proxy for operations that might fail. It monitors for failures and, after a certain threshold, "trips" or opens the circuit, causing subsequent calls to fail immediately without trying to execute the real operation.</li>
            <li>After a timeout, it allows a limited number of test requests to pass through (half-open state) to check if the downstream service is healthy again.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>How can we make our system more resilient to failures in downstream services?</li>
